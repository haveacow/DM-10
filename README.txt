Data Mining: Week 10

There are two .R files included here.
The runcode.R file contains the lines of code one must enter to the console to perform the actions explained in the report.
The functions.R file contains the functions necessary to do this.

The functions from functions.R must be loaded into R before it is possible to run any of the lines from runcode.R

Thanks.
